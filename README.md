## Introduction

🎓 Recursion is a powerful technique used in programming to solve complex problems by dividing them into smaller, manageable subproblems. It allows developers to express elegant solutions by utilizing function calls that invoke themselves with modified parameters.

This repository serves as a resource for understanding and implementing recursion in various programming languages. It provides a collection of commonly encountered recursive algorithms, along with explanations and examples to help you grasp the concepts and apply them to your own projects.

## Features

✨ This repository includes a wide range of recursive algorithms, covering different problem domains such as searching, sorting, tree traversal, graph traversal, dynamic programming, and more.

🌐 Each algorithm is implemented in multiple programming languages, including but not limited to Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, and Ruby. This allows you to compare and learn recursive techniques across different languages.

💡 Detailed code examples are provided for each algorithm, along with explanations of the underlying recursive logic. These examples will help you understand how to implement recursion effectively and efficiently.

🙌 We encourage developers to contribute their own recursive algorithms and examples in any programming language. Your contributions can help expand the collection and create a valuable resource for the programming community.

## Installation

⬇️ To use the code in this repository, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/han-dann/recursion.git
Replace your username with your GitHub username. Make sure you have Git installed on your machine before running this command.

## Usage

🚀 Each algorithm is organized into separate directories, named after the algorithm or problem it solves. Inside each directory, you will find implementations in different programming languages. Choose the language of your choice and explore the code and accompanying documentation.
